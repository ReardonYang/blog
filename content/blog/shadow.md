And someday 

In the mist of time 

When they asked me if I knew you 

I'd smile and say you were a friend of mine 

And the sadness would be lifted from my eyes 

Oh when I'm old and wise 

As far as my eyes can see.. 

There are shadows surrounding me.. 

And to those I leave behind 

I want you all to know 

You've always shared my darkest hours 

I'll miss you when I go
